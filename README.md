Quantified Pony
==
Quantified Pony is the Fitbit for horses. Despite being a $40 billion market in the United States alone, equestrian sports are distinctly lacking in useful technologies that take advantage of today's computing capabilities. One particularly important application is equine gait analysis. Studying the equilibrium of horses offers insights into their physical wellbeing, and is often used for early lameness detection. However, most quantifiable gait analysis techniques require specialized equipment that isn't accessible outside of academic environments. Quantified Pony is a real-time web app that analyzes the gaits and motion of horses using no specialized hardware other than a smartphone. Technology stack: Python, Javascript, JQuery, Firebase, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap.
